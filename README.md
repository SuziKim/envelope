This repository consist of code fragments from the project [Abstraction of
Man-Made Shapes](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/nest/imager/tr/2009/Abstraction/). This
particular piece of code is responsible for generating the envelope of a given
3D shape.  One can start tracing the algorithm from ``OnGenerateEnvelope(...)``
function.
